{"text": "Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al.
